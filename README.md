The errors you're encountering appear to be related to several different issues:

React Router "No routes matched location": This indicates that the route for / is not properly defined. Ensure that your routing is correctly set up in your App.js or App.jsx file, especially the default route ("/"). Double-check your Router, Routes, and Route components.

Failed requests to /api/user and /api/cart: These requests are failing because the frontend is trying to reach localhost:5000, but the backend URL is incorrect or not accessible. Ensure that:

The backend is correctly deployed and running.
Your frontend .env file has the correct VITE_API_URL pointing to the backend, like https://biodiversidad101.onrender.com.
Axios 500 Internal Server Error for registration: This indicates a backend issue when trying to process the registration. Check the backend logs for more details on what is failing when /api/register is called. This might be due to a misconfigured database or an issue with the registration logic.

Steps to troubleshoot:
Check your routes: Ensure your routing in React is set correctly, especially for the home ("/") and the /register page.
Backend connection: Verify the .env in your frontend includes VITE_API_URL=https://biodiversidad101.onrender.com.
Backend error logs: Check the logs on Render for the backend server to see what is causing the 500 error.
API connection: Use console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL) in the frontend to ensure the environment variable is loaded correctly.
